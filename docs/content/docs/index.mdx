title: UsefulKey
description: Simple, self-hosted API key generation and verification.

---

UsefulKey is a small, extensible library for generating, storing, verifying, and revoking API keys. It ships with a lightweight plugin system and swappable adapters for your infrastructure.

It can be used as a single in-process service in your app, or paired with your own HTTP layer to run a central key service. It's designed to be easy to use and extend, with a focus on simplicity and flexibility.

## Features
- Key generation with prefixing
- Pluggable storage and rate limit backends (see [Adapters](/docs/adapters))
- Plugins: rate limiting, IP access control, usage limits per key, permissions/scopes, enable/disable keys (see [Plugins](/docs/plugins))
- Analytics for storing audit history and usage metrics
- Write your own plugins and adapters to extend the functionality with ease

## Why?

I built UsefulKey because I was tired of dealing with key management for each new project I created. The current solutions were overkill for what I actually needed. Most solutions were either not designed for just keys or tied to specific providers.

There are tons of great solutions out there, but most of them felt like overkill for what I actually needed.

UsefulKey is a simple library that does one thing - managing API keys without the hassle. It's lightweight and works with whatever infrastructure you're using.
## Install

``` npm
npm i usefulkey
```

See [Configuration](/docs/concepts/configuration) and the [API Reference](/docs/api/verify-key) for more information.
