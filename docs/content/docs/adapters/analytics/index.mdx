title: Analytics Adapters
description: Emit audit/usage events to your observability stack.

Current adapters:

- [Console](/docs/adapters/analytics/console)
- [ClickHouse](/docs/adapters/analytics/clickhouse)
- [Noop](/docs/adapters/analytics/noop)

By default, UsefulKey uses the Console analytics adapter when none is provided, so events like `key.created`, `key.verified`, etc., are logged to the console.
To completely disable analytics, use the Noop adapter:

```ts
import { NoopAnalytics, usefulkey } from "usefulkey";

const uk = usefulkey({
  adapters: {
    analytics: new NoopAnalytics(),
  },
});
```
