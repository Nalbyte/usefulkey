## What is rate limiting?

Rate limiting controls how many requests a client can make in a period of time. It protects your API from abuse, reduces accidental overload, and helps enforce fair use across users or IPs.

Common examples:

- Limit each IP to 100 requests per minute
- Limit each user to 1 upload every 5 seconds
- Limit a specific API key to 1,000 requests per hour

## When should I use it?

- To prevent spikes that can slow down or crash your service
- To keep costs under control for public APIs
- To enforce plan limits (free vs. paid)

## Core concepts for UsefulKey rate limiting

- **Identifier**: Who or what is being limited. Often an IP address, user ID, or API key. By default, UsefulKey uses `identifier -> ip -> key` (in that order). You can override it per call or via plugin settings.
- **Namespace**: A label to group limits by feature or surface (for example, `"global"`, `"api"`, `"auth"`, `"uploads"`). Rate limits are tracked per `(namespace, identifier)`. Namespaces are required when the rateLimit plugin is used.
- **Strategy**: The algorithm used to enforce limits. UsefulKey supports fixed window and token bucket.
- **Precedence**: On each verification, UsefulKey applies at most **one** limit:
  - If the verifyKey call passes a `rateLimit`, it is used.
  - Else, if the plugin has a `default`, it is used.
  - Else, error.

## Available strategies

- **Fixed window**: Allow N requests in a time window (for example, 100 per minute). Simple and predictable.
- **Token bucket**: Start with a capacity, refill tokens over time, and consume per request. Smooths bursts while keeping an average rate.

Sliding window is not supported yet. See [Roadmap](/docs/additional-info/roadmap) for more details.

## How to use the rate limiting plugin
