Before we get into the adapters let's quickly outline the difference between plugins and adapters.

## Plugins vs Adapters

Quick mental model: **Plugins decide what to do; Adapters decide where it goes**.

- **Plugins (features and policies)**

  - Extend UsefulKeyâ€™s behavior without touching your infrastructure.
  - Run at specific lifecycle points (create/verify functions) to allow/deny or update state.
  - Can also add typed properties or helpers to the `uk` instance.
  - Examples: **rate limiting**, **IP allow/deny**, **usage limits per key**.
  - Choose them per instance when you call `usefulkey(...)`.

- **Adapters (infrastructure backends)**
  - Tell UsefulKey where and how to persist or send data.
  - Implement interfaces for your stack: `KeyStoreAdapter`, `RateLimitStoreAdapter`, `AnalyticsAdapter`.
  - Swap in Postgres/Redis/your own services instead of the default in-memory versions.
  - Choose them once at boot via the `adapters` option in `usefulkey(...)`.


Next we'll dive into the adapters and plugins in more detail.
